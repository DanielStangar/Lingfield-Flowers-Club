            <h3>About our Flower Club</h3>

            and sharing tried and tested tips.<br>

            <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Lingfield & District Flower Club was formed in September 1995 
                    - with 60 members and annual subscription was Â£12.50!<br>
                A few year later, members were encouraged to enter competitions - at district, area and national level. Their confidence
            grew and in the year 2000 two members entered the RHS Chelsea Flower Show and were 
        delighted to receive a Silver Gilt Medal in their class. Those members who decided they
    enjoyed competitive work, have continued to enter Area and National Shows as well as RHS Chelsea. 
<br><br>We are particularly proud of our President, Ann Kennedy, who was runner up in the NAFAS Diamond Show in the 
Designer of the Year category and who has most recently won a Gold Medal for her
design at the September 2021 RHS Chelsea Show.</p>
