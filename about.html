            <h3>About our flowers club</h3>
            <p>Our Flower Club helps take the mystery out of floral design for people just like you who love flowers and want to learn
            more!
            We meet at 7:30pm, usually on the 4th Monday of the month at Lingfield and Dormansland Community Centre,High Street,
            Lingfield where talented Demonstrators produce floral displays showing the latest techniques & sharing tried and tested
            tips.
            We also hold Workshops to learn new skills and organise fun social events.
            Visitors are always welcome, or why not join us and enjoy a full range of member benefits and events."

            <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Lingfield & District Flower Club was formed in September 1995 - with 60 members and annual subscription of Â£12.50!<br>
                A few year later, members were encouraged to enter competitions - at district, area and national level. Their confidence
            grew and in the year 2000 two members entered the RHS Chelsea Flower Show and were 
        delighted to receive a Silver Guilt Medal in their class. Those members who decided they
    enjoyed competitive work, have continued to enter Area and National Shows as well as RHS Chelsea. 
We are particularly proud of our President, Ann kennedy, who was runner up in the NAFAS Diamond Show in the 
Designer of the Year category and who has most recently won a Gold Medal for her
design at the September 2021 RHS Chelsea Show.<br>
Our members now seem to prefer the friendship of other Club members and continue to
enjoy what the Club has to offer - monthly meetings, workshops, social events and outings. 
To encourage members to explore and practice their talents, a monthly "have a go" session has proved to be popular.</p>
