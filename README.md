# Lingfield-Flowers-Club

This is the website for a local flower club, in fact a group of enthusiasts who train themselves in flower arrangement. I am making it free of charge as a self-imposed apprenticeship. On the home page is an animated advert run by JavaScript, about page, gallery of flower arrangement works, the page offering paid membership that will be connected to Stripe, page offering services of an online florist (conection to one or two online floristries who pay commissions for each sale) and then contact page with a working contact form. 
The website will undergo some small adjustments requested by customers and will be ready for live deployment.
Later I plan to add to it some back end functionality so that the club menagement can advertise their future events and courses.
